## What's Saran?
A thin, protective coating for MyMLH that'll let you view your MyMLH data and add functionality with minimal code (because most of it's right here).

For [HackISU](http://hackisu.org), I used MyMLH as a primary registrations tool because it's simple, reliable, and has all the fields for a memberf event. I ran into a problem though, when trying to integrate with other services (like mailchimp), or visualize the data. My life turned into a living hell of downloading an importing csv's. 

So, like any hacker, I started writing code to help me out which led to [MyMLH Dashboard](https://github.com/ghmeier/my-mlh-dashboard). That's all fine and good, but WE WANT MORE. So, __saran__ was born to give that little extra bit on top of MyMLH.

So, how does it work??
